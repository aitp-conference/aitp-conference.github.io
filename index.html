<h4>What is AITP??</h4>

The Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Theorem Proving (AITP)
is a yearly meeting where researchers in the areas of artificial
intelligence, automated reasoning, machine learning,
computer-understandable mathematics and proof assistants come to
discuss how to progress with automation of reasoning, mathematics and
science. For more information look at the pages of the particular instances of the conference.
