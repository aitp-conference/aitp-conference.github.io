Title: Formalizing Mathematics-In Praxis: First Experiences with Isabelle/HOL

Abstract:
This talk is an overview of my first year of Isabelle/HOL, working
within the ALEXANDRIA project at the University of Cambridge, as a pure
mathematician with no prior formalization experience.
I give a summary of our work so far and I comment on some of the early
difficulties I encountered, as my goal is to point out some suggestions
that could make Isabelle more practical for current and future users as
well as to share with new users several technical and conceptual
observations that might prove to be helpful in their early learning
stages.
