FINAL CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS - EXTENDED DEADLINE

Artificial Intelligence and Theorem Proving,
AITP 2025
August 31 - September 5, 2025, Aussois, France

http://aitp-conference.org/2025

Deadline: Extended to May 12, 2025
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aitp2025

BACKGROUND
Large-scale semantic processing and strong computer assistance of
mathematics and science is our inevitable future. New combinations of
AI and reasoning methods and tools deployed over large mathematical
and scientific corpora will be instrumental to this task.  The AITP
conference is the forum for discussing how to get there as soon as
possible, and the force driving the progress towards that.

TOPICS

- AI, machine learning and big-data methods in theorem proving and mathematics.
- Collaboration between automated and interactive theorem proving, in
  particular their AI/ML aspects.
- Common-sense reasoning and reasoning in science, relations to general AI.
- Alignment and joint processing of formal, semi-formal, and informal
   libraries, Formal Abstracts.
- Methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics and science.
- Combinations of linguistic/learning-based and semantic/reasoning methods
- Formal verification of AI and machine learning algorithms, explainable AI .
 

SESSIONS

There will be several focused sessions on AI for ATP, ITP,
mathematics, relations to general AI (AGI), Formal Abstracts,
linguistic processing of mathematics/science, modern AI and big-data
methods, and several sessions with contributed talks. The focused
sessions will be based on invited talks and discussion
oriented. AITP'25 is planned as an in-person conference.

LOCATION AND PRICE

The conference will take place from August 31 to September 5 2025
in the CNRS Paul-Langevin Conference Center
(https://www.caes.cnrs.fr/sejours/centre-paul-langevin/) located in
the mountain village of Aussois in Savoy.  Dominated by the "Dent
Parrachée", one of the highest peaks of La Vanoise, Aussois is located
on a sunny plateau at 1500 m altitude, offering a magnificent panorama
of the surrounding mountains and a direct access to the park of La
Vanoise in summer and downhill ski slopes or cross country slopes in
winter. The total price for accommodation, food and registration for
the five days will be around 600 EUR.

ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE

Aussois is less than 2h from the airports of Lyon, Geneve, Chambery,
Annecy, Grenoble and Turin. There are trains and buses from these
airports. Aussois is 7km from the Modane TGV station with direct
trains from/to Paris. We will organize a bus for the participants from
there to Aussois. Further buses to these airports / station can be
found at http://www.altibus.com/ .
