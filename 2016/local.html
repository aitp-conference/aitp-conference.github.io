    <h2 align="center">1st Conference on Artificial Intelligence  and Theorem Proving</h2>
    <h1 align="center">AITP 2016</h1>
    <h3>April 3–7, 2016, Obergurgl, Austria</h3>
  </div>


<h4>Local Information</h4>
<p>
The conference will start in the afternoon of the 3rd.
We will provide a bus from Innsbruck to Obergurgl at 11am on the 3rd.
</p>

<p>
If you want to join the bus, you can either arrive to Innsbruck
in the morning of the 3rd or arrive earlier and book a hotel
in Innsbruck for the night 2nd/3rd. There are many reasonably
priced hotel options in Innsbruck. Depending on your arrival
near the city center (train station) or near the airport may
be convenient.
</p>

<p>
Or you can decide to travel directly to Obergurgl yourself.
Then you can take a train to Ötztal-Bahnhof and take a public
bus to Obergurgl from there. This is particularily useful if
you come from the Switzerland direction, then you do not need
to pass by Innsbruck.
</p>

  <p>
    Remember to take clothes appropriate for the weather, in
    particular if you like to join skiing (ski-lift passes
    50m from the conference center) you may bring with you
    some equipment. Rental is also possible in the Obergurgl
    village.
