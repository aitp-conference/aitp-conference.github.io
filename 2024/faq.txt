Q: Can I get a public bus to Aussois?

A: Yes, you can take the public "Altibus" line from Modane, and get off at the Le Coin stop, which is just above the Paul Langevin center. You need to book in advance, but it’s cheap (8€ per person), and conveniently the summer service runs until September 6. See https://www.altibus.com/ .
