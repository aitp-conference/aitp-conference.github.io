Q: Can I get a public bus to Aussois?

A: Yes, you can take the public "Altibus" line from Modane, and get off at the Le Coin stop, which is just above the Paul Langevin center. You need to book in advance, but it’s cheap (8€ per person), and conveniently the summer service runs until September 6. See https://www.altibus.com/ .

Q: When is the last session?

A: The last session is on Friday morning and it ends with the lunch.

Q: When does the center close?

A: The center usually closes after lunch on Friday. They are relaxed about it and people can stay e.g. until 4pm if they want.

Q: What about the return trip? 

A: People just enter their departure times and share taxis. The center will be collecting this information during the conference and optimizing the taxi size/sharing. You can also tell us in the registration form. Since the taxi ride to Saint Michel/Jean is longer than to Modane (which is still not usable for trains due to the repair work) we could try to arrange a smaller bus this year for a particular time after lunch. Note that there are also public/SNCF buses from Modane to Saint Michel/Jean and Bardonecchia. 

Q: Any more info about the public bus (altibus.com)?

A: On Sunday it leaves from Modane to Aussois at 16:45 or 13:25.  On Friday it leaves from Aussois to Modane at 11:03 or 15:03. The afternoon "train" bus from Modane seems to leave at 13:38. (So this works if one plans to get lunch in Modane.)

Q: Any more info about travel to Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne?

A: Apart from travelling via Paris/Lyon and Milan/Turin, consider also travelling via Switzerland (Geneva, Zurich, etc.). There are trains available from Geneva to Chambery and to Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne.
